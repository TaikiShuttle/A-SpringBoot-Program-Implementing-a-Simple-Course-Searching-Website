# A SpringBoot Program Implementing a Simple JI Course Searching Website
### Basic Information
This is a local-based program. A MySQL database is created including two tables. They pre-record the `user information` and `course information`. 
The user can first login with his/her account and then search whether JI has this course using the course code. 

### Further Improvement
The further improvement may include adding the feature to show the detailed information for the target course. And add functions to remove or modify the courses already
exist in the database.
